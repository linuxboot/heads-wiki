Generate the `qemu.rom` image:

```Makefile
make BOARD=qemu-coreboot
```

Boot it in qemu:

```Shell
build/make-4.2/make BOARD=qemu-coreboot run
```

Issues with emulation:

* TPM is not available
* Xen won't start dom0 correctly, but it is sufficient to test that the
 `initrd.cpio` file was correctly generated
* This also lets us test Xen patches for legacy-free systems
* SATA controller sometimes takes minutes to timeout?
