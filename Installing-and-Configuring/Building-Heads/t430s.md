This guide only documents build options you might be interested in, which are:
If you are not interested in those options follow the [General Building](/general-building/) guide.

- Setting an arbitrary MAC address.
- Change some BIOS options (like swap the fn and ctrl-key)

# Preparation

Follow the [General Building](/general-building/) until you have installed all dependencies and cloned the tree. _Do not_ execute `make BOARD=t430s-maximized` yet!

# Edit build (optional)

## Change MAC (via coreboots bincfg)

```bash
cd coreboot/utils/bincfg/
make

#
# Open gbe-82579LM.set and change the MAC address.
#

./bincfg gbe-82579LM.spec gbe-82579LM.set gbe_0x1000.bin
cat gbe_0x1000.bin gbe_0x1000.bin > /path_to_heads_dir/blobs/t430s/gbe.bin
```

## BIOS options

You can enable certain options like: swap the fn and ctrl key, enable sticky fn key etc.

```
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/coreboot/coreboot.git
cd coreboot/src/mainboard/lenovo/t430s/
# Open the cmos.default file and enable or disable the options you like. Save the file and close it.
git diff cmos.default > ~/heads/patches/coreboot-4.13/0061-cmos-settings.patch
```

## Set different flash chip in flashrom arguments

**This step is only necessary if non of the detected chips matches MX25L12835F/MX25L12845E/MX25L12865E.**

- Open `heads/boards/t430s-maximized.config` with an editor.
- Search for `CONFIG_FLASHROM_OPTIONS=`
- Replace `-c MX25L12835F/MX25L12845E/MX25L12865E` with `-c <your chip name>`.

Run the build again and copy the new `coreboot.rom` to the USB dongle.

# Build Heads
```
make BOARD=t430s-maximized
```

Wait. Building will take some time...

The `coreboot.rom` image will be copied to `build/coreboot-4.13/t430s-maximized/coreboot.rom`.
Copy it to a USB dongle and follow the [Flashing Guide](/t430s-flashing/).
