Fully resetting a card
===

If you mess up the admin pin it is necessary to do a full reset of
the PGP applet.  These instructions worked for me:
[https://developers.yubico.com/ykneo-openpgp/ResetApplet.html](https://developers.yubico.com/ykneo-openpgp/ResetApplet.html)
I had to install `scdaemon` and start `gpg-agent` to make them
work, but eventually that `gpg-connect-agent -r yubikey.reset`
script did the right thing:

```shell
/hex
scd serialno
scd apdu 00 20 00 81 08 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
scd apdu 00 20 00 81 08 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
scd apdu 00 20 00 81 08 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
scd apdu 00 20 00 81 08 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
scd apdu 00 20 00 83 08 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
scd apdu 00 20 00 83 08 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
scd apdu 00 20 00 83 08 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
scd apdu 00 20 00 83 08 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40
scd apdu 00 e6 00 00
scd apdu 00 44 00 00
```
