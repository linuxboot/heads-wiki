## Prerequisits

### Hardware
- The USB dongle with the Heads binary (`coreboot.com`).
- A Raspberry Pi and either:
	- jumper wires (6xFemale-Female, 3xFemale-Male), a Bread-Board
	- OR 6xFemale-Female, 3 jumper wires, the equipment to solder a "Y-jumper wire" to connect two pins to one 3v3 output.
- A [Pamona SOIC-8 Clip](https://www.pomonaelectronics.com/products/test-clips/soic-clip-8-pin) (You can also try a cheaper one, but I failed with it).
- A computer to connect to the RasperrbyPi

### Software

- `raspi-config` to enable SPI on the RaspberryPi. If your Raspberry runs the default OS ([Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/)) it is already installed.
- `flashrom` on the Raspberry Pi (`sudo apt install flashrom`).
- (optional) [OpenBoardView](https://openboardview.org/)


## Flash Heads

### **Disassemble the laptop**

Follow _chapter 9_ of the [Lenovo maintenance guide](https://download.lenovo.com/ibmdl/pub/pc/pccbbs/mobiles_pdf/t430s_t430si_hmm_en_0b48538_01.pdf) to disassembly the laptop.
You do not have to remove the smart card reader, the speakers and the Bluetooth card and its switch.

Though don't forget to remove the media card reader (page 75).

After you have taken out the mainboard flip it around.

The flash memory is located here:

![T430s-board](/images/T430s_board.jpg)

And has the following pin layout.

![T430s-chip](/images/T430s_chip_annotated.jpg)

In case you want reassure yourself: get the [board view file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2mH6ffKfXjCUWJUb0FKa2g5SE0/view) to check out the pin layout there. You can open it with [OpenBoardView](https://openboardview.org/).

### **Prepare the Raspberry Pi**

First, you need to enable the SPI device on the Rapsberry Pi.

Do this by run `sudo raspi-config` and enable it under `Interface Options`. Reboot the Raspberry Pi.

Now connect the clip to the Raspberry Pi by using the jumper wires:

| Pi Pin | GPIO | chip pin        |
|--------|------|--------------|
| 1      | First 3v3   | Vcc (8) |
| 17     | Second 3v3  | WB (3), HOLD (7) |
| 19     | 10          | MOSI (5)  |
| 21     | 9           | MISO (2) |
| 23     | 11          | CLK (6)   |
| 24     | 8           | CS0 (1) |
| 39     | Ground      | GND (4) |

Since the RaspberryPi has only two 3v3 outputs you need to connect the WB and HOLD pin to the same 3v3 output. Use the bread board or your soldered wire for that.

### **Probe the chip**

Connect your USB dongle to the Raspberry and `cd` into it.

Connect the clip to the chip.

> In case flashrom can't detect or read the chip consider the following:
> - If your Raspberry Pi is connected to an laptop USB port plugin the laptop to the AC.
> - The legs of the chip are really tiny and wear down quickly. Does the clip has a proper connection to the chips legs?
> - Checkout flashroms [common problems](https://www.flashrom.org/Common_problems).
> - If noting helps you probably have to replace the chip on the mainboard. 
>   Here is a [guide](https://tobiasmanske.de/posts/thinkpad-coreboot-part1/) for that.

Detect the chip.

```
sudo flashrom -p linbux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0,spispeed=10000
```

Flashrom should detect **two** chip types. One of them is `MX25L12835F/MX25L12845E/MX25L12865E`. Ignore the other one.

In case **non** of the detected chips match `MX25L12835F/MX25L12845E/MX25L12865E` you have to rebuild Coreboot unfortunately.

> If you have to rebuild:
> - Write down the name of the chip and follow [the build guide](/t430s-building/#set-different-flash-chip-in-flashrom-arguments) to edit the configuration.
> - Also replace `MX25L12835F/MX25L12845E/MX25L12865E` with your chip name in each of the commands below.

### **Backup and flash**

1. Backup the current BIOS

	```
	sudo flashrom -p linbux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0,spispeed=10000 -c MX25L12835F/MX25L12845E/MX25L12865E -r ./dump_1.bin 
	sudo flashrom -p linbux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0,spispeed=10000 -c MX25L12835F/MX25L12845E/MX25L12865E -r ./dump_2.bin 
	sudo flashrom -p linbux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0,spispeed=10000 -c MX25L12835F/MX25L12845E/MX25L12865E -r ./dump_3.bin 
	```

2. Compare hash sums

	```
	sha256sum -b dump_1.bin > hashvalues.txt 
	sha256sum -b dump_2.bin >> hashvalues.txt 
	sha256sum -b dump_3.bin >> hashvalues.txt 
	```
	Compare the hash sums. If they do not match, read the content again and compare until they match.

	Copy the dumps and `hashvalues.txt` to your USB dongle.

	Those dumps are your backup of the current BIOS! You can flash them in case something went wrong and your laptop won't boot.

3. Flash Heads

	```
	sudo flashrom -p linbux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0,spispeed=10000 -c MX25L12835F/MX25L12845E/MX25L12865E -w coreboot.rom 
	```

Once its done assemble your laptop and boot into Heads.

Continue with [configuring keys](/Configuring-Keys/).
