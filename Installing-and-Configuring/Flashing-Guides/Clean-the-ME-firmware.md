What is the Intel Management Engine
===

The Intel ME is a coprocessor, running inside your Intel CPU, which is supposed
 to function as a out-of-band management system for your computer.  
It's based on a ARC/i386 core depending of the version, can be powered even when
the main CPU is off and has more privileges than the CPU itself.  
More info: [Intel Active Management Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technology)

How to disable/deactive most of it
===

The ME firmware sits on the second SPI flash chip of the x230 (the 8MB one). We
 cannot remove it completely, otherwise the machine will shut itself off after
 30 minutes. We can, however, reduce it to the bare minimum necessary to keep it
 running, but without any malicious code in it (or so we hope, depending of what
   the ROMP and BUP modules really do...).

The initial step is to upgrade the proprietary BIOS to the last upgradeable
 version one for each platform.
As an example, for the x230, the latest upgradeable version would be
 [version 2.76](https://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs/mobiles/g2uj32us.iso) without
 [EC signature verification](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/len-27764)
 . Newer firmware version [won't permit to swap a x220 keyboard on the x230](https://github.com/hamishcoleman/thinkpad-ec/pull/130)
 .  

Prepare a USB bootable disk by following
 [el torito instructions](https://askubuntu.com/questions/651281/write-bootable-bios-update-iso-to-usb-stick)
 , then boot that prepared USB disk and upgrade the prioprietary firmware to
 latest available version following on screen instructions. Be sure to have a
 fully charged battery, be connected to power source prior of attempting to
 upgrade, else you will have to wait for the battery to be changed.

Once the proprietary firmware is updated to the latest available user ownable
 version, take a flash dump of the bottom SPI chip and verify that its backup is
 valid.

Flashrom can be downloaded on most linux distribution on the external laptop
 that will be used to flash the cleaned rom. (`sudo dnf install flashrom` or
 `sudo apt-get install flashrom`.

With a ch341a programmer, the command would look like the following:

```shell
sudo flashrom -r ~/down.rom --programmer ch341a_spi && \
  sudo flashrom -v ~/down.rom --programmer ch341a_spi
```

If they match, clone this repo:  
`https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner.git`  
and then run:  
`python ~/me_cleaner/me_cleaner.py -c flash.bin`  
to check if it's a valid ME firmware.  
The output should be like:  

```text
Full image detected
The ME/TXE region goes from 0x3000 to 0x4ff000
Found FPT header at 0x3010
Found 23 partition(s)
Found FTPR header: FTPR partition spans from 0x183000 to 0x24d000
ME/TXE firmware version 8.1.30.1350
Checking FTPR RSA signature... VALID
```

If it's not, replace the reprogrammer clip and try again :)  

Next, unlock the descriptor and ME regions with ifdtool. We consider here that
 you already build Heads through `make BOARD=x230`:
`~/heads/build/x86/coreboot-4.13/util/ifdtool/ifdtool -u down.rom`
This produced a new unlocked rom under `down.rom.new`

Next, let's strip all the nasty bits:  

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```shell
python ~/me_cleaner/me_cleaner.py -r -t -d -S -O clean_flash.bin down.rom.new --extract-me extracted_me.rom
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Output:

```

After that, you got your new, cleaned up version of the ME firmware inside
clean_flash.bin  
Flash it back on the SPI:

`sudo flashrom -w clean_flash.bin --programmer ch341a_spi`

You're now good to go :)
