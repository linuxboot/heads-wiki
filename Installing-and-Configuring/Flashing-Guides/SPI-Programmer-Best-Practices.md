# SPI Programmer Best Practices

This guide provides essential information for safely flashing SPI chips using external programmers, with recommendations based on extensive community testing and feedback.

## ⚠️ Critical Safety Warning

**ALWAYS disconnect all power sources before flashing:**
- Remove battery
- Disconnect AC adapter
- Disconnect CMOS battery (recommended for extra safety)

**Never connect or disconnect the clip while the programmer is powered on.** This can damage your motherboard or SPI chip.

## Recommended Programmers (in order of preference)

Based on extensive community testing and feedback, here are the recommended SPI programmers:

### 1. **Tigard (Recommended)**
- **Cost**: $67-89 USD
- **Speed**: ~21 seconds for 8MB chip, ~42 seconds for 16MB chip
- **Voltage**: 1.8V, 3.3V, 5V, external target voltage
- **Protocols**: SPI, I2C, JTAG, SWD, UART
- **Additional features**: Logic analyzer, USB debugging support
- **Reliability**: Excellent (4/4 success rate in community testing)
- **Best for**: Development, debugging, frequent flashing, new users

**Where to buy**: [Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/securinghw/tigard)

### 2. **CH341A Rev 1.6+ (Budget option with voltage selector)**
- **Cost**: $5-15 USD
- **Speed**: ~120 seconds for 8MB chip
- **Voltage**: 1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V, 5V (selectable via switch)
- **Protocols**: SPI, I2C
- **Reliability**: Good when used correctly
- **Best for**: Occasional flashing, budget-conscious users

**⚠️ Important**: Only use CH341A rev 1.6+ with voltage selector. Older versions output dangerous 5V.

**Visual identification**: Look for the voltage selector switch and additional components:

- **Reliability**: High
- **Best for**: DIY enthusiasts, custom setups

### 4. **BeagleBone Black (Advanced debugging)**
- **Cost**: $60-90 USD
- **Speed**: ~16 seconds for 16MB chip
- **Voltage**: 3.3V, some pins 1.8V
- **Additional features**: EHCI debugging, serial console

## Essential Safety Procedures

### Before Starting
1. **Power disconnection checklist**:
   - [ ] Remove laptop battery
   - [ ] Disconnect AC adapter
   - [ ] Disconnect CMOS battery (recommended)
   - [ ] Wait 30 seconds for capacitors to discharge

2. **Workspace preparation**:
   - Use anti-static wrist strap
   - Work on anti-static mat
   - Ensure good lighting
   - Have magnifying glass available

### Voltage Selection Guidelines
1. **Start with 1.8V**: Most modern SPI chips prefer 1.8V
2. **Try 3.3V**: If chip detection fails at 1.8V, try 3.3V
3. **Never use 5V**: Unless specifically required by chip datasheet
4. **Test detection**: Run `flashrom -p [programmer]` to verify chip detection

## SPI Chip Pin Mapping (SOIC8)

```
Chip Pin Layout (top view, dot indicates pin 1):
┌─────────────┐
│ 1 ●       8 │
│ 2         7 │
│ 3         6 │
│ 4         5 │
└─────────────┘

Pin Functions:
1 - CS / CS#     (Chip Select)
2 - SO / MISO    (Serial Data Output)
3 - WP# / N/C    (Write Protect)
4 - GND          (Ground)
5 - SI / MOSI    (Serial Data Input)
6 - SCLK / CLK   (Clock)
7 - HOLD# / N/C  (Hold)
8 - VCC          (Power)
```

## Connection Procedures

### Using Tigard
```bash
# Basic connection test
sudo flashrom -p ft2232_spi:type=2232H,port=B,divisor=4

# With chip specification
sudo flashrom -p ft2232_spi:type=2232H,port=B,divisor=4 -c "MX25L6405D"
```

### Using CH341A rev 1.6+
```bash
# Basic connection test
sudo flashrom -p ch341a_spi

# With chip specification
sudo flashrom -p ch341a_spi -c "MX25L6405D"
```

## Flashing Workflow

### 1. Chip Detection and Backup
```bash
# Test connection and detect chip
sudo flashrom -p [programmer]

# Create backup (run twice to verify)
sudo flashrom -r backup1.bin -p [programmer] -c "[chip_model]"
sudo flashrom -r backup2.bin -p [programmer] -c "[chip_model]"

# Verify backups match
diff backup1.bin backup2.bin
```

### 2. Verify Backup Content
```bash
# Check backup contains data (not all 0x00 or 0xFF)
hexdump -C backup1.bin | head -20
```

### 3. Flash New Firmware
```bash
# Flash with retry loop (recommended)
false; while [ $? != 0 ]; do 
    sudo flashrom -p [programmer] -c "[chip_model]" -w firmware.rom
done
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Chip not detected**:
- Check clip connection and orientation
- Try different voltage (1.8V → 3.3V)
- Verify all power sources are disconnected
- Check clip contact pressure

**Verification fails**:
- Increase clip pressure
- Clean chip pins with isopropyl alcohol
- Try lower clock speed (for Tigard: increase divisor)
- Check for oxidation on clip contacts

**Partial writes**:
- Usually indicates poor connection
- Re-seat clip and try again
- Consider using probe-style adapter for better contact

### WSON8 Package Tips
For WSON8 packages (surface mount without leads):
- Use specialized WSON8 probe with alignment guide
- Apply gentle downward pressure during operation
- Consider using flux for better electrical contact

## Performance Optimization

### Tigard Speed Optimization
- Use `divisor=4` for reliable operation
- Use `divisor=2` for maximum speed (may be less stable)
- Enable progress indicator: `--progress`

### CH341A Optimization
- Ensure clean power supply
- Use shorter USB cable
- Keep programmer cool during long operations

## Advanced Features

### Tigard Logic Analysis
Tigard can function as a logic analyzer for debugging SPI communication issues.

### BeagleBone Black EHCI Debugging
When configured with screwdriver firmware, BeagleBone Black can capture boot logs via EHCI debugging.

## Summary

For most users, **Tigard is the recommended choice** due to its:
- Fast operation (saves time during development)
- Multiple voltage options (safe for all chips)
- Additional debugging capabilities
- Excellent reliability record

For budget-conscious users, **CH341A rev 1.6+ is acceptable** but:
- Verify it has voltage selector switch
- Expect longer flash times
- Limited to basic SPI operations

**Never use old CH341A programmers** without voltage selection - they can damage your hardware.
