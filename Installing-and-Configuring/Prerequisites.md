Prerequisites for Heads
===

Required equipment
---

To install Heads on a physical device, you will need:

* Supported motherboard or laptop ([see below](#supported-devices))
* A heads compatible USB security dongle ([see below](#USB Security Dongles))
* A heads compatible storage device for your public GPG key (USB flash drive)

If your device requires external flashing ([see below](#supported-devices)),
 you will also need:

* [SPI Programmer](https://trmm.net/SPI_flash): ch341a programmer or raspberry
 pi or bus pirate (ch341a is recommended for new users and can be found almost
 [anywhere](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=ch341a+programmer).
* Wires and a clip SOIC8 to connect your programmer of choice to the boardâ€™s
 SPI flash chip(s).
  * The [Pomona 5250](https://www.pomonaelectronics.com/products/test-clips/soic-clip-8-pin)
   is suggested as it is high quality and easier to make contact with the pins.
* A second computer to flash from (Try to use a recommended operating system:
  Qubes or Debian 9 or Fedora 30)
