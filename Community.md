Matrix channel

* [Matrix Channel, once bridged to Slack channel](https://matrix.to/#/#OSFW-Heads:matrix.org)

Notice : The Slack channel is now under free tier for the past year+ and may look like Heads is dead. That's unfortunate and not under my control. The free tier has only 90 days of chat history and is inferior to the integration provided by Element/Matri, which haven't loss its chat history, even after Slack bridge went dead. The community lives over Matrix and GitHub. 

Unfortunately, there is not much I can do for the Slack side. Until apps linked to the Slack channel are removed so that the Matrix bridge is back active and connected, I am not present over Slack but through Matrix. I reminded folks responsible on 19/04/2024 once more and edited this page accordingly.

Please use the Element/whatever client works for you (open source) with the Matrix channel referred above. That channel is alive and the ecosystem is evolving. Slack channel is dead until fixed by either Ronald Minnich or Felix Singer which have the proper permissions to do something about it on the Slack side of things.

Once fixed, please open an issue under heads-wiki to correct this notice accordingly.
